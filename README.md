# Program 2: Sorting
### London Kasper and Hazel Eroy

**Summary**

This program implements six different sorting algorithms and compares the performances on different set sizes

Sorting algorithm implemented:
- insertion sort
- randomized quicksort
- merge sort
- shellsort
- introsort
- timsort

<br>"You’ll write a report on the analysis of the data in the README.md.  I won’t dictate the requirements, but I would like you to answer the following questions:
- How did you generate the various data sets?
- How does the performance of the various sorting algorithms differ between randomized data and pre-sorted data? Does this change with integers vs strings? - How do the algorithms perform as the datasets grow very large?  
- Does the performance of the sorting algorithms match published upper bounds?  
- How does the performance of the algorithms change as duplicates are introduced?
- How does the performance of the algorithms change when the input is mostly sorted?
- Which algorithm is the best?

Generate appropriate graphs for each data organization (randomized, sorted, etc) that plot the various data set sizes against run time.  Include a CSV file of your raw data in your repo.
